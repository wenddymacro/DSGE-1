# Solution to DSGE using Deep Learning in Tensorflow
In recent years, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models are being used increasingly in central banks as a tool to formulate the monetary policy and maintain the financial stability. Deep learning possesses many attractive features for solving DSGE models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) possess high representational capacity, allowing them to learn complex, highly nonlinear behavior, value, and policy functions. Moreover, DNNs exhibit good generalization properties, allowing them to solve high-dimensional problems accurately without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. There is no free lunch, however. The learning process of DNNs is stochastic in nature. Thus, the added stochasticity inherent in DSGE models destabilizes the learning and makes it less efficient. Additionally, the learning is farther destabilized by the presence of many hard and soft model constraints and by the need for custom, highly complex loss functions (such as those requiring the derivatives of the neural network with respect to the inputs). Such obstacles often make the network training process slower than normal, unstable, and difficult to converge. In this study, we have examined solving a DGSE model using custom DNNs implemented in Tensorflow.
